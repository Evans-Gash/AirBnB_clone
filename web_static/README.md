1. **What is HTML?**
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It consists of a set of tags that define the structure and elements of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

2. **How to Create an HTML Page**
To create an HTML page, you start by opening a text editor and writing the HTML code. The basic structure includes the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element containing `<head>` and `<body>` sections. The content goes in the `<body>`, while the `<head>` contains metadata like title, links to stylesheets, and more.

3. **What is a Markup Language?**
A markup language is a system for annotating a document's content to define its structure, presentation, and relationships. HTML is a prime example of a markup language, where tags provide meaning to the content they enclose.

4. **What is the DOM?**
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, each representing a part of the document. This model allows scripts and programs to dynamically interact with and modify the content and structure of web pages.

5. **What is an Element/Tag?**
In HTML, an element (also called a tag) is a fundamental building block. It consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Elements define the structure and content of a web page, such as headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), and more.

6. **What is an Attribute?**
Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element. They are added to the opening tag and help define an element's behavior, appearance, or interaction. For example, the `href` attribute in an anchor tag (`<a>`) specifies the link's destination.

7. **How Does the Browser Load a Webpage?**
When a browser loads a webpage, it sends a request to the web server for the page's resources. The server responds with HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and more. The browser then processes these resources, rendering the HTML structure, applying styles, and executing scripts to display the webpage.

8. **What is CSS?**
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. It allows you to define colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to create visually appealing and consistent designs.

9. **How to Add Style to an Element?**
You can add styles to HTML elements using CSS. Inline styles are applied directly within an element's opening tag using the `style` attribute. Alternatively, you can link an external CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

10. **What is a Class?**
A class is a way to group multiple HTML elements together to apply the same styling or behavior to them. By assigning the same class name to multiple elements, you can target and modify them collectively using CSS or JavaScript.

11. **What is a Selector?**
A selector in CSS is a pattern used to target specific elements for styling. Selectors can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. They define which elements the associated styles should be applied to.

12. **How to Compute CSS Specificity Value?**
CSS specificity determines which styles are applied when multiple conflicting styles target the same element. It's calculated based on the combination of selectors used in the rule. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by IDs, classes, and element selectors.

13. **What are Box Properties in CSS?**
Box properties in CSS control the sizing, spacing, and layout of elements. These properties include `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and more. They define how an element occupies space, interacts with other elements, and creates the overall visual structure of the webpage.
